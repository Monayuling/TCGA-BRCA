# TCGA-BRCA
Differential Analysis


**This code aims to explore the differences in gene expression of samples from the TCGA BRCA project:**



**This project has several major components:**

>   DESeq analysis to find differential expressed genes from TCGA BRCA
>
>   Gene ontology to map significant genes to biological pathways
>
>   Survival analysis to find factors influencing overall survival and disease free survival
>
>   Deconvoluted data from TCGA BRCA from the CIBERSORT dataset 



**Notice:**

>    TCGA RNA-Seq is stored in ENSG_IDs, need to be convered to gene name for DESeq analysis
>
>    use 'counts' for DESeq analysis
>
